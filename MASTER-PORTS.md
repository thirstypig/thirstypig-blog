## Port Ranges by Product (Reserved Blocks)

Each product owns a 10-port block (3XX0–3XX9 frontend, 4XX0–4XX9 API). Sub-services expand within-block — never cross-assign.

Never cross-assign ports between projects. Each product owns its 10-port block
(e.g., thefantasticleagues owns 3010-3019 and 4010-4019). If a new service
needs a port, assign it within the owning project's reserved range. Consult
the AVAILABLE rows in MASTER-PORTS.md before creating any new product.
```

## 📐 Conventions

- **10-port blocks per product.** Frontend block mirrors the API block (3010↔4010, 3030↔4030, etc.) so the math stays easy.
- **-www marketing sites** share the same block as their -app sibling, offset by 1 (e.g., app=3010, www=3011).
- **Databases follow convention:** PG starts at 5442 (+1 per product), Redis at 6381 (+1 per product). Skip numbers as needed to avoid OS-reserved ranges.
- **Unified-server apps** (alephco.io-app) only claim the API port; the "Frontend" column is empty because Vite is served through the Express process.
- **When retiring a product**, mark its block as `**AVAILABLE**` with a dated note; do not delete the row for 30 days so in-flight work can find it.
- **Vite HMR ports** (24680+) are per-project and rarely conflict; just keep them distinct if two Vite dev servers run side-by-side.

## 📝 Changelog

- **2026-08-07** — **Corrected the shengchangmd row, which named a dead host in all 37 copies of this file.** The registry said `shengchangmd.bahtzang.com`; that host has 404'd since the migration to **shengchangmd.com** completed on 2026-08-05 (apex on Squarespace nameservers, four GitHub Pages A records, `www` redirecting to apex, one Let's Encrypt certificate covering both). Ports are unchanged at FE 3120.
  - **The mirroring worked and the correctness did not.** The 2026-08-05 minmeychang sync propagated cleanly to every copy — all 37 were byte-identical when this was found — and not one of them was right. Mirroring guarantees the copies agree with each other; it guarantees nothing about whether they agree with reality, and a fact nobody is looking at goes stale in every copy simultaneously.
  - **Nothing pointed at the stale row, because nothing was broken.** The migration was completed, verified and documented inside the `shengchangmd` repo, whose own `CLAUDE.md` and runbook were updated the same day. This registry sits outside that repo, so it was never in view. Cross-repo facts have no owner unless one is named.
  - **Historical entries below are deliberately left naming the old host.** The 2026-07-30 and 2026-08-04 entries record what was true when written; rewriting them would destroy the record rather than correct it. Only live claims were changed.
- **2026-08-05** — Added **minmeychang** (Astro static, bilingual en/zh-hant; family tribute site for Min Mey Chang) on **FE 3170**, claiming the FUTURE-5 block (3170–3179 / 4170–4179). Static only, so 4170/5455/6394 stay unassigned within the block. Live on GitHub Pages at **minmeychang.com**, an apex domain on Squarespace DNS. Opened a fresh **FUTURE-6** block (3180–3189 / 4180–4189, PG 5456, Redis 6395) to hold the "always one slot free" invariant.
  - **Claimed before `npm run dev` was ever run** — second time in five entries this happened in the right order. `npm run build` was run during scaffolding, but that binds no port. Dev is pinned to `-p 3170` in `package.json`.
  - **Squarespace emits an `HTTPS` (RFC 9460) record that silently defeats an apex migration.** The registrar's "Squarespace Defaults" preset bundles the four parking `A` records, the `www` CNAME **and** an `HTTPS` record at `@` whose `ipv4hint` lists the parking IPs. Browsers query HTTPS records in parallel with `A` and prefer those hints, so Chrome and Safari keep reaching Squarespace even with perfect GitHub `A` records — while `dig +short A` reports success. Deleting the preset removes all three together. **This will bite the `shengchangmd.com` migration** once that zone lands on Squarespace; the runbook does not mention it, because GoDaddy did not emit the record.
  - **`dig` 9.10.6 (macOS system dig) cannot query `HTTPS`/`SVCB`.** It silently downgrades the unknown type to an `A` query — the QUESTION SECTION comes back `IN A` — and returns a confident, wrong answer. Use `dig -t TYPE65` instead. An earlier check in this session reported an HTTPS record present that it had never asked about.
  - **A `200` proves nothing about which server answered.** After DNS was correct at 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1, `curl https://minmeychang.com/` still returned `200` with a valid certificate — from Squarespace's parking page, because the local macOS resolver held the old IPs on their original 4-hour TTL. The tells were `%{remote_ip}` and the `server:` header. Verify migrations with `curl --resolve <host>:443:<target-ip>`, never against whatever the local resolver believes.
  - **New Pages repos default to `build_type: legacy`, which inverts the `CNAME` rule.** On legacy branch builds the `CNAME` file in the branch is authoritative and overwrites the repo's custom-domain setting on every deploy; on `workflow` builds it is inert and the setting rules. Left on `legacy`, GitHub would also try to Jekyll-build the Astro source. Switch with `gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages -f build_type=workflow` before the first deploy.
  - **The custom-domain field 404s until Pages has built once.** The repo had zero commits, so `main` did not exist and there was no site to attach a domain to. Order is: push → first successful deploy → set `cname` → enable `https_enforced`.
- **2026-08-04** — Added **theresewhite.com** (Next.js 16 static export; rebuild of L. Therese White's Wix site) on **FE 3160**, claiming the FUTURE-4 block (3160–3169 / 4160–4169). Static export to GitHub Pages at theresewhite.bahtzang.com, so 4160/5454/6393 stay unassigned within the block. Opened a fresh **FUTURE-5** block (3170–3179 / 4170–4179, PG 5455, Redis 6394) to hold the "always one slot free" invariant.
  - **Claimed before the dev server was ever run**, which is the first time in four entries this happened in the right order (see tobinchang 2026-07-31 and shengchangmd 2026-07-30, both retroactive). `npm run dev` is pinned to `-p 3160` in `package.json` rather than left on Next's default 3000.
  - **Corrected a stale DNS assumption.** `bahtzang.com`'s nameservers are `ns-cloud-*.googledomains.com` with a `cloud-dns-hostmaster.google.com` SOA, which reads as Google Cloud DNS. It isn't a separate console: Squarespace acquired Google Domains and migrated domains kept those nameservers, so Squarespace's DNS panel is the correct place to add records. The live `shengchangmd.bahtzang.com → thirstypig.github.io.` CNAME is the proof.
  - **Found one drifted mirror:** `thefantasticleagues/thefantasticleagues-app/MASTER-PORTS.md` was still on 2026-04-20 — the same file called out as "on a version of its own" in the 2026-07-31 sync. It had drifted again within four days. Re-synced with the rest.
- **2026-07-31** — Added the three personal-site projects **tobinchang** (FE 3130), **jarrenchang** (FE 3140) and **rhyschang** (FE 3150), extending the registry with two new blocks (3140–3149, 3150–3159) and a fresh **FUTURE** block (3160–3169) so the "always one slot free" invariant holds. All three are static sites bound for GitHub Pages on their own apex domains, so API/PG/Redis in each block stay unassigned.
  - **Block order was set by what was already running, not alphabetically.** `tobinchang` had a `python3 -m http.server 3130` live at assignment time, so it kept 3130 rather than being moved; reassigning would have broken a running dev server mid-session. This is the failure the "claim before you run" rule exists to prevent — the claim happened after the fact for the second time in three entries (see shengchangmd, 2026-07-30).
  - **Corrected a stale row:** `spar` was renamed to **TIP** in commit `283e8bd` ("refactor: rename the product Spar → TIP across code, copy and docs"). Same 3110–3119 block, now deployed on Railway at tip.bahtzang.com. There is no `spar` folder on disk; the registry had been pointing at a product name that no longer existed.
  - **Re-synced all mirrors.** The copies had drifted into **4 distinct versions across 35 files** despite the byte-identical rule — the `ktv-singer/*` sub-repos (7 files) and a tastemakers/alephco/bbq-judge/thefantasticleagues group (10 files) were both stale, and `thefantasticleagues-app` was on a version of its own. All 35 `MASTER-PORTS.md` and 20 `PORTS.md` copies now match the root.
- **2026-07-30** — Added **shengchangmd** (Astro 5 static site for Sheng Chang, M.D.; trilingual en/zh-hant/zh-hans) on **FE 3120**, claiming the FUTURE-2 block (3120–3129 / 4120–4129). Static only — no API, PostgreSQL or Redis in use, so 4120/5450/6389 stay unassigned within the block. Deployed to GitHub Pages at shengchangmd.bahtzang.com. Registry was retroactive: the project had been running on 3120 before the block was claimed.
- **2026-07-09** — Added **spar** (Next.js 16 App Router; Retell voice + Stripe later; staging spar.bahtzang.com) on **FE 3110**, claiming the FUTURE-1 block (3110–3119 / 4110–4119). Mirrored MASTER-PORTS.md + PORTS.md into the spar folder. Also removed a stray empty `package-lock.json` from `~/Projects` that was confusing Next.js's workspace-root detection.
- **2026-06-30** — Added **vouch** (Next.js 16 + Supabase cloud) on **FE 3020**, claiming the reclaimed fsvppro block (3020–3029). Mirrored MASTER-PORTS.md + PORTS.md into the vouch folder and re-synced all project copies; also added the missing PORTS.md to alephco.io. Vouch dev server pinned to `-p 3020`.
- **2026-05-11** — Full sync: updated date, added top-level MASTER-PORTS.md + PORTS.md to all project folders (alephco.io, bbq-judge, thefantasticleagues). Created root PORTS.md quick-reference and README.md for Projects folder.
- **2026-04-20** — Major restructure: added alephco.io, bahtzang-trader, tabledrop, jameschang.co, thirstypig, cooper-stack3, and `-www` marketing sites. Resolved 3 port conflicts (3060, 4060, 3030). Retired fsvppro block.
- **2026-03-08** — Initial 5-project registry (fbst, fvsppro, bbq-judge, ktv-singer, tastemakers).
